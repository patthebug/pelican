Summary: 

After having a career in Software Engineering for close to five years in Bangalore(India) and London(UK), where I developed and designed various desktop apps and websites using various technologies, I decided to build my business acumen and went to Australia to pursue my first Masters degree - MBA. 

It was during this time when I was introduced to possibly the hottest buzz phrase ever, "Big Data". Analytics caught my attention immediately and I scooted over to Silicon Valley for a career in Data Analytics. The title "Data Scientist" allured me and my quest began.

I recently finished my second Masters degree, "MS in Analytics" and over the past one year, I have worked with four companies as intern.
